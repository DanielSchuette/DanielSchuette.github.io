On this website, I will post about topics related to computer science that either interest me or that I want to put into words to get a better understanding of them. Most things will probably be **Unix**- and **Systems Programming**-related, maybe some **algorithms**, **compilers** or anything else I read about or code. Just go to my [GitHub](https://github.com/DanielSchuette) if you want to learn more about my projects or contribute to one of them. Questions or feedback via email or twitter are always welcome, too!
