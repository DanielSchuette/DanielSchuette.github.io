Welcome to my corner of the internet!

On this website, I will mainly write about computer science. That is, either things that interest me or that I want to put into words to get a better understanding of them.

Actually, most topics will probably be related to **Unix**- and **Systems Programming**, maybe some **algorithms**, **compilers** or anything else I read about. Sometimes, I might post code that I wrote because I think it's somehow educational. Don't expect too much, though!

Just go to my [GitHub](https://github.com/DanielSchuette) if you want to learn more about my projects or contribute to one of them. Questions or feedback via comments below an article, [email](mailto:d.schuette@online.de), or [twitter](https://twitter.com/DogtorDash) are always welcome!!
