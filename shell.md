The following series of posts describes the process of writing a shell (a command interpreter, a command prompt, a shell prompt, or whatever other word you might have for it) in a **Unix**-derived operating system. Everything will be explained from first principles, so don't worry if you've never thought about how your shell might operate internally. All code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/DanielSchuette/c_shell), although posts and repo are probably out-of-sync all the time ðŸ¤·.
