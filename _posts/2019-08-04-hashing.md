Hashing is an omnipresent concept in computer science. A hashing function takes an arbitrary-length input[^1] and returns a fixed-length output. That output can be used for a multitude of applications, most prominently for indexing into a table (a so-called hash table), for secure password storage, or for implementing cashes. Thus, knowing the basics of hashing comes in handy for almost every programmer at some point in time. In this post, we'll explore important properties of hashing functions and demonstrate a simple hash table implementation in **C**. In the end, you'll have learned enough to use hashing effectively for your projects[^2].

[^1]: Oftentimes the input is a string, but it can as well be an integer.
[^2]: Also, this post serves as additional documentation for [`hashtest`](https://github.com/DanielSchuette/hashtest), a utility for evaluating the collision rates of hashing functions.
